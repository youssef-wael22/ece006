      <ul> with machine learning (including its most advanced deep learning techniques), analytic AI scans tons of data for dependencies and patterns to ultimately produce recommendations or provide a business with insights, thus contributing to data-driven decision-making.</ul>

      <ul> analysis and supplier risk assessment are just a few examples of analytic AI in action. If you’d like to get a complete picture of how such a solution works, our experts have summarized the insights gained from their experience with two of the use cases – inventory optimization and demand forecasting.</td>
    <td>Functional AI is very similar to analytic AI – it also scans huge amounts of data and searches for patterns and dependencies in it. However, instead of giving recommendations, functional AI takes actions. For instance, being the part of the IoT cloud, it can spot a machine-breakdown pattern in the sensor data received from a certain machine, and trigger a command to turn this machine off. Another example: robots that Amazon uses to bring the shelves with the goods to the pickers, thus speeding up the picking process.</ul></td>
    <td><ul> type of AI allows businesses to automate communication without compromising on interactivity. To envisage this type of AI, think of chatbots and smart personal assistants whose abilities can vary from answering pre-built questions to understanding the conversation context.</ul>

      <ul> AI can serve another purpose – improving a company’s internal processes. For example, one of our projects was dedicated to creating a chatbot to facilitate the corporate process of vacation booking.</ul></td>
    <td><ul> that use text AI can enjoy text recognition, speech-to-text conversion, machine translation, and content generation capabilities. Even if a company is not Google or Amazon, or any other giant company that provides text AI as a service, it can still take advantage of this AI type. For example, the company can use text AI to power an internal corporate knowledge base.</ul>

      <ul> to a traditional knowledge base that rests upon a search by keywords, an AI-powered one can find the document containing the most relevant answer even if the document doesn’t have full keywords. This is possible thanks to semantic search and natural language processing, which allow AI to build semantic maps and recognize synonyms to understand the context of the user’s question.</ul></td>
    <td><ul> visual AI, businesses can identify, recognize, classify and sort objects or convert images and videos into insights. A computer system that helps an insurer to estimate damage based on damaged car photos or a machine that grades apples based on their color and size are the examples of visual AI. This type of AI covers computer vision or augmented reality fields.</ul>

      <ul> get the real feel of the value that visual AI can bring, you can read in more detail about a face recognition solution that we developed to help a retailer enhance and personalize their customer service; or about an application for automated inspections that allowed a manufacturer to immediately control the quality of the produced details.</ul></td>
